        <p>My hobby is playing basketball. I go for basketball coaching. It also helps me to increase my height and keep me fit and healthy.I play it regularly with my friends. I wish one day I will be in my school's basketball team. Michael Jordan is my favourite basketball player and I espire to be like him when I grow up.
